# Battleship
BattleShip Game in Java Fx using Design Patterns.



Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of the other's various 
ships. A paper and pencil version of the game dates back to World War I, but most people are familiar with the game through the 
plastic board game that was first marketed by the Milton Bradley Company in 1967. Since then, the game has spawned various video
games and smartphone app variations. Today, the board game version is produced by Hasbro, which acquired Milton Bradley in 1984. 

The object of the game is to guess the location of the ships each player hides on a plastic grid containing vertical and horizontal
space coordinates. Players take turns calling out row and column coordinates on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a
square that contains a ship.
